# SM-J400M LTE - Root

I published this repository in order to save my files and tools to ROOT my Samsung Galaxy J4 ( SM-J400M lte ) device.

If you want, feel free to use what I have made available, however, any damage caused to your device will be your responsibility.

## Some useful informations

To get information about your device from Treble support, it is recommended to use the [Treble Info app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=tk.hack5.treblecheck&hl=pt_BR&gl=US).

I have provided some information about J4LTE from the [treble_experimentations repository](https://github.com/phhusson/treble_experimentations/wiki/Samsung-Galaxy-J4).
